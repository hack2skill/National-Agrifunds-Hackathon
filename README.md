## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Sahyogi is a simple prototype to demonstrate financial transactions using UPI, USSD and UPI Lite with seamless shifting between them according to network connectivity. As NPCI doesn't provide open APIs for any of these technologies, we are not able to fully integrate this prototype. But the solution, we proposed, is more efficient and robust as it covers every case (Good,Low and No network connectivity as well).
  To explain the usage of API/USSD service, we have given pop-ups in the prototype app. Reading the content of those pop-ups can surely explain our idea. If given a chance to work further and fully implement the idea by assitance in UPI and USSD APIs, we can connect the untouched population, deprived of good network connectivity, connect with banks, manage their funds efficiently and get access to eligible government schemes.

## Tech Stack: 
   XML
   Java
   Material UI
   USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) *99#
   UPI and UPI Lite APIs

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  Prerequisite:
    Android Studio is installed on your computer

  Steps:
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Open the project in Android Studio
    3. Open MainActivity.java file and run the app using 'run' button on right side of app bar
    4. Test the app
  
## What I Learned:
     During the development period of Sahyogi, we researched extensively for technologies that can be used in low network areas. Also we got deep inside UPI technology. We learned how Government thinks in perspective of technology to serve the nation. Unfortunetly, we are not able to get UPI API. If we get access to APIs and guidance from NABARD and NPCI teams, we can surely make our app completely ready for deployment. But, the brain storming done by entire team for finding a solution was indeed extraordinary.
     Currently, we are in 5th semester of Computer Science Eng. in IIIT Dharwad and we have a course, Computer Networks. By participating in this hackathon, we got some more knowledge about computer networking which is crucial for us. 
     Besides tech,the development of this prototype app taught me that technology should serve users, and designing with the user in mind is pivotal. It's not just about writing code; it's about crafting an experience that meets user expectations and needs. This realization has transformed the way I approach app development, emphasizing empathy, usability, and continuous improvement.
