## A Brief of the Prototype:

  Our prototype is an Android app designed to provide seamless financial services to individuals in areas with limited internet connectivity. By combining user-friendly design with robust technology, our app ensures easy access to banking services, even for those with minimal digital literacy. Here's a brief overview of the prototype's key features:

  1. User-Friendly Interface:Our app boasts a simple and intuitive user interface, carefully designed to cater to users of all technological backgrounds.

  2. Connectivity Adaptibility: One of the standout features of our prototype is its adaptability to different connectivity scenarios.

  3. Internet Connectivity: In the presence of an internet connection, our app establishes a connection with the bank servers and facilitates seamless transactions.

  4. SMS Connectivity: In the absence of an internet connection, our app automatically switches to SMS mode, allowing users to perform transactions through SMS.

  5. Regular Backups: Our app regularly backs up all transactions to ensure that users can recover their data in case of any errors.
